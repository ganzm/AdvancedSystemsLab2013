\section{Messaging System}
In this section the system under test (also named as middle ware component) is described.


%% ----------------------------------------------
\subsection{Overview}

Figure \ref{fig:system-overview} shows a generic setup of the messaging system. Multiple middle ware components are connected to a single database and severs a couple of clients. Application state is persisted on the database, therefore a middle ware component can be considered as stateless.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:middleware-threading} shows important software components of a single middle ware. A nonblocking network interface (NIO) handles communication to the clients. Received data is put to a single thread safe request queue.

A configurable number of workers are constantly reading from the request queue. As soon as a worker gets a piece of work (request raw data) it then performs the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item decoding: The raw request is parsed and converted into a request java object
\item process: The request is processes. The database is accesses and a response object is created
\item encode: The response object is serialized and placed into the response queue of the network interface.
\end{itemize}
