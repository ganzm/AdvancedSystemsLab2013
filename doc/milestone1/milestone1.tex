\section{Messaging System}
In this section the system under test (also named as \textbf{middleware}  or \textbf{broker}) is described.


%% ----------------------------------------------
\subsection{Overview}

Figure \ref{fig:system-overview} shows a generic setup of the messaging system. Multiple middleware components are connected to a single database and severs a couple of clients. Application state is persisted on the database, therefore a middleware component can be considered as stateless.

  \label{fig:system-overview}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:middleware-threading} shows important software components of a single middle ware. A nonblocking network interface (NIO) handles communication to the clients. Received data is put to a single thread safe request queue. A configurable number of workers are constantly reading from the request queue. If there is nothing to do these threads are blocked (no busy wait). As soon as a worker gets a piece of work (request raw data) it then performs the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item decoding: The raw request is parsed and converted into a request java object
\item process: The request is processes. The database is accesses and a response object is created
\item encode: The response object is serialized and placed into the response queue of the network interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Middleware to Database Interface}

The interface to the database is abstracted through the the classes located in package \textit{ch.ethz.mlmq.server.db.dao}.

\begin{itemize}
\item MessageDao - handles access to the message table
\item ClientDao - creates and deletes clients
\item QueueDao - creates and deletes queues
\end{itemize}

These classes encapsulate all database access performed bye the middleware bye using PreparedStatements\footnote{\url{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/prepared.html}}. PreparedStatements tend to be faster than normal Statements because they can be precompiled on the database system.

\subsubsection{Stored Procedures}
Database operations which would have required more than one (Prepared)Statements per request are implemented as StoredProcedures. This reduces unnecessary database roundtrips.

\section{How to run the System}

This section describe all the important things laying around the core messaging system.

\subsection{Database setup}

To setup the database required for the middleware there are two options
how to create one.

\subsubsection{Automatic setup}
You can run the java class \textit{ch.ethz.mlmq.main.Main} which is located in the main project folder \textit{mlmq}. Run the class without parameters to get usage informations.

Sample Start parameters may look like this:

\begin{verbatim} 
java ch.ethz.mlmq.main.Main dbscript -url jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432 -db mlmq -user myusername -password mypassword -createDatabase -createTables
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Manual setup}
Use your favourite database management tool (pgadmin) and execute the following sql scripts which can be found here:

\begin{verbatim} 
resource/db/001_table_create.sql
resource/db/002_stored_procedures.sql
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Configuration}
Configurating software components is done with properties file. \footnote{See \url{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/properties.html} for further information.}
\subsubsection{Main Configuration}
\label{subsub:MainConfig}

Have a look at the example configuration located at the following place.

\begin{verbatim} 
resource/config.example.properties
\end{verbatim}

Most of the configuration should be self explanatory. An exception may be the the part which is dynamically generated part when executed via test infrastructure (see figure \ref{fig:SampleConfig}). This part of the configuration describes the configuration of an experiment.

\begin{verbatim} 
common.scenario.mytype
\end{verbatim}
Describes whether this configuration file belongs to a client or a middleware instance.

\begin{verbatim} 
common.scenario.myposition = n
\end{verbatim}
Together with \textit{common.scenario.mytype} it determines whether to pick the n-th configuration from\textit{ common.scenario.mapping.broker} or \textit{common.scenarion.mapping.client}.

\begin{verbatim} 
common.scenario.mapping.broker=...
\end{verbatim}
Lists the Broker scenarios to use. Where the first item corresponds to a class name followed by ip address and port

\begin{verbatim} 
common.scenario.mapping.client=...
\end{verbatim}
Lists the client scenarios to use. Where the first item corresponds to a class name followed by ip address.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{verbatim} 

...

##################################################
# Dynamically generated per test run from here on
##################################################

...

# Scenario mapping format: name1:ip,ip,ip,...;name2:ip,ip,...;name3:ip,ip,...
# E.g. scenario.mapping = broker:127.0.0.1,192.168.0.2;client:127.0.0.1,192.168.0.1
# Here: only one broker and one client
common.scenario.mapping.broker = SimpleShutdownBroker#127.0.0.1:8099;SimpleShutdownBroker#127.0.0.1:8100,127.0.0.1:8101
common.scenario.mapping.client = SimpleSendClient#127.0.0.1;SimpleSendClient#127.0.0.1;SimpleSendClient#127.0.0.1;SimpleSendClient#127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1

# either broker or client
common.scenario.mytype = client

# If the position is 5 and mytype is a broker, then this means that this is the 5th broker
# myposition starts at position 0
common.scenario.myposition = 0

...

\end{verbatim}
\caption{Sample Config}
\label{fig:SampleConfig}
\end{figure}  	

\subsubsection{Logging Configuration}
\label{subsub:loggingConfig}
Both the messaging system and the client implementation use \textit{java.util.logging.*} to log system events like errors, component startup/shutdown. This log is completely separated from the performance log (see \ref{subsub:PerfLogConfig} ), which is performed on a separate basis.

A valid logging configuration can be found here

\begin{verbatim} 
resource/logging.properties
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Performance Logging Configuration}
\label{subsub:PerfLogConfig}

As already state performance logging is separated from the default logging. Any activity which may be interesting to measure is logged via this performance logger. This logger is configured via the main configuration file (see \ref{subsub:MainConfig}) and is kept simple. You just specify a path where the performance logger puts the file

\begin{verbatim} 
# folder where to write the performance log
common.performancelogger.logfilepath = performance_log
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Start a Middleware instance/Client}
As soon as both main and logging configuration files are prepared starting the middleware instance is easy. Just specify both files via command line arguments like the following:

\begin{verbatim} 
java ch.ethz.mlmq.main.Main scenario -config resource/brokerconfig.properties -l resource/logging.properties
\end{verbatim}

Since configuration whether to start as a client or as a server is located inside the main configuration file a client is started in the same way as a middleware.

\subsection{Command Line Interface}

Both client and middleware instance can be controlled using basic commands. These commands are written into the so called command file which is configured in the main configuration like this.

\begin{verbatim}
common.commandofile.path = commando.txt
\end{verbatim}

While the client or the middleware instance is running one can write a single command into this file to be executed. The middleware periodically checks whether the file has changed. If so it tries to execute the command contained in the file.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline 
command & description \\ 
\hline 
shutdown & Gracefully shuts down the middleware \\ 
logstacktrace & Writes the current stack trace of all threads in the virtual machine to the log \\ 
logmemory & Writes the current memory consumption to the log \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Commando File Commands}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Logging}
This chapter describes what is logged rather than how the logging is configured. (Check \ref{subsub:PerfLogConfig} and \ref{subsub:loggingConfig} to see how the logging is configured).

As stated logging is performed with \textit{java.util.logging}. This files are for debugging purposes only.

The \textbf{PerformanceLog} contains timing data which are used to reason about the timing behaviour of the system which has been build.

Except for the first line of the file the structure of the \textbf{PerformanceLog} has a csv file format.


\subsubsection{Columns} represent the following values
\begin{enumerate}
\item Time taken for a specific action
\item UTC timestamp when a specific action was finished
\item Name of the action
\item Different runtime dependant context information. (E.g. C[.] indicates the number of connected clients on a middleware instance)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Action Names}
\label{subsub:PerfLogger-ActionNames}
The following list shows the different types of actions which are logged and their meaning. Action names were chosen to be as short as possible to reduce log file size.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CSndReq} - request/response rountrip measured from a client's perspective 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{BTotReqResp} - time taken from the first received byte to the last sent response byte measured from a broker's perspective.
	\item \textbf{BRcvReq} - time taken to receive a Request. This measures how long it takes to receive all request bytes on the broker.
	\item \textbf{BProcReq} - time taken by the worker. Tells you how long a single worker thread is occupied processing a certain request.
		\begin{itemize}
   		\item \textbf{BDb} - time taken to perform a specific database operation. Since this is measured by the broker jdbc network communication is included here.
   		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{BSndResp} - time taken to send a response.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example Performance Log}
An example performance log is shown in figure \ref{fig:sample-perf-log}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
	\begin{verbatim}

	\end{verbatim}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Sample Performance Log}
  \label{fig:sample-perf-log}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Unit Tests}
While developing the system we strictly relied on unittests which are located in the test folder of the mlmq eclipse project.

In order to have the database related and system unittests working you may need to adjust database connection information located in the following file. This configuration file is used by all Unit Tests which need client specific configuration.

\begin{verbatim}
resource/brokerconfig.properties
\end{verbatim}

\pagebreak

\section{Test Infrastructure}
\label{sec:TestInfrastructure}

To partially automate testing a Ruby on Rails\footnote{\url{http://rubyonrails.org}} web application was developed to help simplify running experiments on the Amazone cloud. It is refered as Testmaster.

  \end{center}
  \caption{Test Master Overview}
  \label{fig:testmaster}
\end{figure}

%% ----------------------------------------------

\subsection{Workflow}

\subsubsection{Create an Experiment}
To run an experiment at first one has to define a new testrun. This is done by hand via a web interface. One has to provide the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\item Define the number middleware instances are set up on how many Amazon instances.
\item Define the workload. This implies choosing how many instances of each client type are needed.
\item Provide client and middleware configuration.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Run an Experiment}
This step is automatically performed without user interaction. The test master performs the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start the required Amazon instances
\item Get the latest binaries of the middleware
\item Copy the binaries and configuration to the Amazon instances
\item Start all the binaries with the required parameters
\item Periodically check whether the experiment is still running.
\item If the experiment has finished, logging information is gathered, compressed and stored on the test master
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Analyze an Experiment}
As soon as an experiment has finished and all logging information is collected the web interface enables two buttons "Analyze" and "Downlodad". 

"Download" allows to get zip file with all the log files created during the experiment.

"Analyze opens a form which provides a web interface for the Log Analyzer (see \ref{subsec:LogAnalyzer}). Plots can be created with only a few clicks.

\subsection{Log Analyzer}
\label{subsec:LogAnalyzer}

In order to semi automatically analyze performance log files which have been created through the process of an experiment, a Java program was written to simplify evaluation of these files.

The project folder (See Section \ref{sec:WhereToFind:MessagingSystemSrc}) contains an Eclipse project called \textit{log\_analyzer}. All you need to do is to provide a path to the folder containing all the log files of an experiment you want to analyze. By executing the class \textit{ch.ethz.mlmq.log\_analyzer.Main} you can choose to either generate a csv file or a gnuplot file\footnote{\url{See http://www.gnuplot.info/}}.


\subsubsection{Example}
The following line of code shows an example of calling the log analyzer.

\begin{verbatim}
java ch.ethz.mlmq.log_analyzer.Main -d logs/test_run_56 -type CSndReq#OK# -fmt csv
\end{verbatim}

The folder found at logs/test\_run\_56 which contains several log files is analyzed and a csv file is created. This file contains timing information for client request/reponse operations (See \ref{subsub:PerfLogger-ActionNames}).

%% ----------------------------------------------
\section{What to find where}

This section should help finding code, experiment data, plots etc.

\subsection{Messaging System Source Code}
\label{sec:WhereToFind:MessagingSystemSrc}
All source code for the messaging system, clients and log analyzer can be found here:

\url{https://github.com/ganzm/AdvancedSystemsLab2013}
and in the svn repository in the folder \textit{ethz-asl-mlmq}.


\subsection{Experiment configurations for each test run, raw data, big files}
The configurations for all test runs, the raw data and the big files can all be found in this repository. Because there is some sensitive information in the configuration files (like database passwords for the middleware), please request access to this repository by writing us your github username. Please handle this data carefully, don't publish it and don't share it.

\url{https://github.com/lukaselmer/ethz-asl-bigfiles}
and in the svn repository in the folder \textit{ethz-asl-bigfiles}.

%\subsection{Experiment Raw data}
%Experiment data is located here:
%
%\url{https://github.com/lukaselmer/ethz-asl-testmaster-data}

\subsection{Testmaster Source Code}
Ruby on Rails\footnote{http://rubyonrails.org/} Testmaster source code is located here:

\url{https://github.com/lukaselmer/ethz-asl-testmaster}
and in the svn repository in the folder \textit{ethz-asl-testmaster}.

It is a standard Ruby on Rails project, so the installation is easy for a Ruby on Rails developer. However, this can be very tricky if this environment is unknown. Therefore it is suggested to use the Testmaster Access described in the next subsection.

\subsection{Testmaster Access}
The Test Infrastructure as described in Section \ref{sec:TestInfrastructure}   \nameref{sec:TestInfrastructure}. This is where you find all experiment data (even the failed ones). Access to this service is communicated by mail, because the service contains sensitive data (like database passwords for the middleware).

\section{Conclusion and lessons learned}

Actually measure a system felt much more difficult than actually building one. Having the plots right seems more difficult than having UnitTests on a green bar.\\

UnitTests can't show the absence of bug. Despite of having a decent test coverage we struggled at this point.  As the project moved on, more and more bugs where discovered and fixed. Each time a software bugfix was applied which potentially affect the performance of the system some of our experimental results were invalidated, or at least not entirely correct any more.\\

An other point which should be improved for the next project is the decision making process. We delayed what exactly to measure and to analyse for too long.\\

Despite the fact that much time went into building the Testmaster, in the end it was a big help. Not heaving the Testmaster in the end phase would probably have meant, that either the bugs couldn't have been fixed or that not so many experiments could have been conducted.\\

Another lesson learnt was that applying statistics can be tricky. Even tough the theory is not that complex and difficult, there are many ways to apply statistics. Not heaving clear specifications for what to measure and what to build in the first place made this task really difficult.\\

In the end, we think that we built a good messaging system. More importantly however we know how to measure systems and we think that we have a good understanding how our system performs. And of course, we are looking forward to the next part.
