Factors and performance test guidelines
=======================================

* Primary factors (about 5-6)
* Secondary factors (e.g. GC, network (Jitter?))
Difference:
Primary: High effect on performance, concentration when running experiments
Secondary: Things which may affect the performance, but are either not as important or cannot be influenced

Response variables: Response time (latency) and throughput
Which factors influence the response time or latency
E.g. # open connections to database

Summary: E.g.: Factor A has 40% impact on latency, factor B has 20% impact on latency, factor A&B combined have 10% impact on latency.

Define ranges, what levels to run
=> Hypothesis
=> If yes => explain why
=> If no => Hypothesis

Think a step ahead => read up the queuing theory => cover the things needed in the last part
=> see book (start with chapter 16 + slides (+ chapters 17-22))
=> exam: questions depending on the milestones
=> understand what's going on
